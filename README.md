Paper: Verification and Runtime Assurance for Dynamical Systems with Uncertainty

Authors: Matthew Abate, Mark Mote, Eric Feron, and Samuel Coogan

Submitted to: 24th ACM International Conference on Hybrid Systems: Computation and Control (HSCC)

Description: This script generates Figures 2 and 3 in the paper. A runtime assurance architecture is formed to ensure the existence of a polytpoic robustly forward invariant set for system with a polynomial vector field, and this runtime assurance mechanism functions in the presence of state uncertainty.
